# Tailwind CSS Law Firm Website Clone

##  Project Overview

This project is a **responsive front-end website clone** built using **HTML5 and Tailwind CSS**. The design is based on a reference law firm website layout provided as an image. The goal of this task was to recreate the layout, structure, and visual styling as closely as possible while using **Tailwind utility classes instead of custom CSS**.

The website includes a header, navigation bar, hero section with a background form, informational content boxes, a detailed practice areas section, and a footer — all structured to closely match the reference design.
