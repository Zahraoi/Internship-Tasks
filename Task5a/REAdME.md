# CSS Law Firm Website Clone

##  Project Overview

This project is a **responsive front-end website clone** created using **HTML5 and traditional CSS** (no frameworks). The design is based on a reference law firm website layout provided as an image. The objective of this task was to recreate the layout, structure, and visual appearance as closely as possible using **custom CSS instead of Tailwind or any CSS framework**.

All styling, spacing, and layout decisions were handled manually through CSS properties such as Flexbox, Grid, margins, padding, and positioning.
