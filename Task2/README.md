#  Catchub Landing Page – Responsive Web Replica

This project is a responsive(somewhat) web replica of the **Catchub mobile application landing page**, developed using **HTML5 and CSS3 only**. The main focus of this task was to accurately recreate the original UI design while ensuring the layout remains usable and visually consistent across different screen sizes.

-----------------------------------

## Project Description
The objective of this task was to transform a static design reference into a fully functional webpage. Special attention was given to layout alignment, spacing, typography, and responsiveness while maintaining the original visual structure.

This project demonstrates practical understanding of:
- HTML page structuring
- CSS positioning
- Responsive design using media queries(somewhat)
- Layout control with Flexbox and custom styling

--------------------------------

## Key Features

1. High-Fidelity Design
- Carefully recreated layout matching the provided design mockup
- Consistent spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy
- Clean and minimal user interface

2. Responsive Behavior
- Layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes
- Desktop layout uses structured positioning for visual accuracy
- Mobile view reorganizes content for better readability without breaking design
- Its not perfectly responsive right now but it will be worked upon

3. Alternating Layout Sections
- **Channels** → Image on left, text on right
- **Messages** → Text on left, image on right
- **In Future** → Image on left, text on right

4. Typography & Styling
- Clean font hierarchy for headings and paragraphs
- Balanced color contrast for accessibility
- Optimized spacing for modern UI feel
